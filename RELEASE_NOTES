R4.6.0: 26-July-2023 E. Gumtow
                Wait to pull values from IPMI devices after init has finished
                initializing the connection to the devices.  Without this,
                querying data would fail, and if the PVs are PINI=yes, then
                those PVs would never successfully populate.

R4.5.0: 27-Apr-2022 E. Gumtow
                Some devices have no data available for a specific system. An
                example are the ATCA fan trays from Advantech. As the user can
                see that the software at least tried to retrieve data, fields
                are filled with N/A.

R4.4.0: 17-Mar-2022 M. Donadio
                Changes implemented by Eric Gumtow:
		- Multi-threaded mchInit resulted on a boot time considerable
                  reduction. For 20 devices the boot went from almost 4 minutes
                  to 20 seconds.
                - Fixed memory leaks.
                - Disentangled ipmiComm module from test application.

  		Reduce number of sensor records for LCLS ATCA shelf,
  		now that we have more experience with the systems

R4.2.6: 13-Jan-2020 S. Hoobler

          Comment out some informational warning messages

R4.2.4: 17-Nov-2019 S. Hoobler

			just slightly misleading messages and a short delay.
		  See Changelog for details.

R4.2.3: 04-Oct-2019 S. Hoobler
		  Bug fix--expected sensor read message length was overwitten,
			causing one extra round of message timeouts during sensor reads.
		  See Changelog for details.

ipmiComm-R1-6-0:  Significantly reduce MCH init time by eliminating read
                    timeouts where possible. Abort mchSdrGetDataAll for
